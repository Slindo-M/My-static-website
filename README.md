# Childhood Hobbies – My First Static Website

This is my first static website project, created to showcase some of my favourite hobbies from my childhood. The goal of this project was to practice basic web development skills while building something fun, personal, and nostalgic.

The website is built using only **HTML and CSS** and is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.
